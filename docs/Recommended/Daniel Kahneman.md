  * *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman explores how humans think through two systems: System 1, which is fast, intuitive, and emotional; and System 2, which is slower, more deliberative, and logical. Kahneman explains how our reliance on System 1 often leads to cognitive biases and errors in judgment. He discusses concepts like loss aversion, anchoring, availability heuristics, and overconfidence. The book reveals how these mental shortcuts affect decision-making in economics, business, and everyday life. Ultimately, Kahneman advocates for greater awareness of our thought processes to improve reasoning and make better decisions in a complex world.
