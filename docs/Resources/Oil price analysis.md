## Estimated Impact of a 1 Million Barrels per Day (mb/d) Production Change

|Production Change|Estimated Price Impact|Context and Considerations|
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
|**+1 mb/d**|**Decrease of $2–$5 per barrel**|An increase in supply can lead to a price drop, especially if demand remains constant. For instance, OPEC+'s production cuts of approximately 2 million barrels per day in April 2025 led to immediate price reactions of $2–$5 per barrel.|
|**−1 mb/d**|**Increase of $2–$5 per barrel**|A decrease in supply can cause prices to rise. The exact impact depends on factors like existing spare capacity and the responsiveness of other producers.|

#### **4. Demand-Supply Balance Rule of Thumb**

* **1 mb/d surplus/demand shift** ≈ **5–10% price change** (empirical OPEC data).
  
  * *Example*: 2022 IEA reserve release (-1 mb/d) lowered prices by ~$8/bbl.

## Oil production cost

Here is a comparative table of estimated oil production costs per barrel by country, based on recent data from various sources:

|Country|Estimated Production Cost (USD/barrel)|Notes|
|-------|--------------------------------------|-----|
|**Saudi Arabia**|$2–$9|Lowest globally due to vast, shallow reserves and efficient infrastructure|
|**Iraq**|$5–$20|Low costs; some fields may have higher expenses|
|**Iran**|$10–$15|Low costs; impacted by sanctions and aging infrastructure|
|**United Arab Emirates**|$10–$20|Low costs; benefits from significant reserves|
|**Kuwait**|$10–$15|Low costs; favorable geology and infrastructure|
|**Russia**|$15–$25|Low to moderate costs; varies by region|
|**Venezuela**|$15–$30|Higher costs due to heavy crude and infrastructure challenges|
|**China**|$35–$40|Higher costs due to complex geology and aging fields|
|**Brazil**|$20–$40|Moderate costs; offshore pre-salt fields are more expensive|
|**Norway**|$40–$60|High costs due to offshore drilling and harsh conditions|
|**United States**|$20–$70|Wide range; shale oil is more expensive than conventional|
|**Canada**|$30–$60|Higher costs for oil sands; conventional oil is cheaper|
|**Nigeria**|~$48.71|Among the highest globally; rising costs impact revenue|
