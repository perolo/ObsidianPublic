Lets assume that the US decides to isolate itself from the rest of the world using import tariffs against the rest of the world. Tariffs are high enough to almost work as total trade barriers approx 30-50%:

Evaluate and extend on the following analysis:

The US: Since imports are large, margins low - almost all the tariffs feed through to the domestic market. This leads to inflation that feeds through to the debt interest rate. raising the repo rate will not help since the inflation is not demand based. Almost all exports are halted since reciprocal tariffs are blocking all trade. An economic recession results in lower oil prices.

japan: All Japanese auto and electronics exports to the US are totally halted, a lot of the other exports are facing a fierce Chinese competition, general global auto sales slump. Japan starts selling all US treasuries resulting in dollar price falling and US yields going up. Japan still needs foreign supplies of oil, coal and iron. Non US exports as previously.

UK: Trade with US grinds to a halt. Trade with rest of the world as before. New trading partners needed! Who the EU?

Sweden: Trade with US grinds to a halt. Trade with rest of the world as before. New trading partners needed!

What happens to the US dollar and rates?

What happens to the JP Yen?

UK: What about the rates?

Great scenario—this is effectively a **quasi-autarkic shock** initiated by the United States, functioning as a **hard decoupling event** from the global economy. Below is an extended analysis, taking into account the transmission mechanisms of trade barriers, inflation, capital flows, and monetary responses in **each country**, focusing especially on:

* **Currency valuation (FX)**

* **Sovereign bond yields (rates)**

* **Macroeconomic policy constraints**

---

## 🔵 **United States: High Tariff Isolation Scenario**

### 🔹 Assumptions Recap:

* 30–50% import tariffs act as de facto trade walls.

* Imports collapse, exports face retaliatory tariffs.

* Global capital retaliates or withdraws from US markets.

* The USD loses global trade demand.

### 🔹 Immediate Consequences:

1. **Cost-Push Inflation**: Tariffs feed directly into **import prices**. Since US production depends heavily on **global supply chains** (autos, tech, retail), costs spike.

1. **Sticky Core Inflation**: Since the cause is **supply-side**, raising interest rates does little. Fed policy is trapped between fighting inflation and avoiding recession.

1. **Collapse in Exports**: Retaliatory tariffs halt US exports. Trade sector shrinks. Ag, aerospace, and energy sectors are hit.

1. **Capital Flight**: Foreign holders (e.g., Japan, China, EU investors) start **divesting Treasuries** due to political and trade uncertainty.

### 🔹 US Dollar (USD):

* **Falls sharply** in FX markets due to:
  
  * Shrinking trade demand (USD needed less for global transactions).
  
  * Capital outflows.
  
  * Weakening US credibility.

* Potential **15–30% depreciation** vs major currencies in short term.

### 🔹 US Rates (Yields):

* **Spiking long-term yields**: Selling of Treasuries by foreign holders (Japan, China) forces yields up.

* Fed may try **yield curve control** or **QE**, but faces stagflationary pressure.

* Repo rate hikes are **ineffective** against imported inflation.

* **Real rates remain negative** → stagflation trap.

### 🔹 Macro Outcome:

**Stagflationary recession**, declining real incomes, weaker USD, deteriorating fiscal position as debt service costs balloon.

---

## 🔵 **Japan: Export Collapse and Financial Rebalancing**

### 🔹 Trade Shock:

* US-bound exports (cars, electronics) grind to zero.

* Global demand for industrial goods weakens → broader export slump.

* Auto sector experiences global contraction, not just bilateral.

### 🔹 Financial Shock:

* Japan holds ~$1.1 trillion in US Treasuries.

* Geopolitical and FX pressures lead to **divestment of USTs**, putting upward pressure on US yields.

* Yen strengthens **initially** as capital repatriates.

### 🔹 JPY (Yen):

* **Short-term appreciation** due to repatriation and “safe haven” flows.

* But weakened export base and reliance on **imported energy** (USD-denominated) create a **twin pressure**: JPY **later weakens** modestly.

 > 
 > Net: **Volatile Yen**—stronger first, then correction as trade and energy pressures hit.

### 🔹 JGB Yields:

* BoJ likely maintains **yield curve control** to prevent bond market instability.

* Inflation risk remains low; Japan avoids the US stagflation.

* But growth falters.

---

## 🔵 **United Kingdom: Decoupled from US, No Easy Anchor**

### 🔹 Trade:

* US-UK trade halts (~15–20% of UK exports affected).

* UK has limited global-scale manufacturing to reorient.

* Now cut off from both **EU single market** (Brexit) and **US trade**.

### 🔹 FX and Capital Flows:

* Sterling sees **mild depreciation**, reflecting a weaker growth outlook.

* However, the UK still trades freely with **Canada, Australia, Asia**, and **Middle East**.

### 🔹 UK Rates:

* Inflation pressures rise slightly due to **supply-side friction** (energy, tech goods).

* BoE raises rates only marginally.

* Long-term yields rise due to **weaker growth outlook**, and foreign demand for Gilts could falter if confidence declines.

 > 
 > Overall: **Higher nominal yields**, but less pronounced than the US.

---

## 🔵 **Sweden: Small Open Economy Navigates Carefully**

### 🔹 Trade:

* Direct US exposure is low (~6% of exports), but **indirect exposure** via global supply chains and demand shock matters.

* Sweden continues trading with **EU, China, Nordics, and Asia**.

### 🔹 SEK (Swedish Krona):

* Moderate depreciation due to risk aversion, especially if global capital flows retreat to "core" currencies (CHF, JPY).

* Sweden lacks global reserve currency status → **SEK weakens modestly**.

### 🔹 Swedish Rates:

* Riksbank may stay dovish to support growth amid external shock.

* Inflation impact moderate: Sweden can still import from EU/Asia.

* Bond yields **rise slightly**, reflecting global contagion and risk premia.

## 🔵 FX and Yield Forecast Summary (Under Hard US Tariff Shock)

|Country|**Currency Reaction**|**10-Year Yield Impact**|**Drivers**|
|-------|-----------------|--------------------|-------|
|**US**|USD ↓↓↓ (15–30%)|Yields ↑↑↑ (due to selling + inflation)|Capital flight, loss of export income, imported inflation|
|**Japan**|JPY ↑→↓ (volatility)|Stable (YCC maintained)|Treasury divestment, safe haven demand, energy imports|
|**UK**|GBP ↓ (mild)|Yields ↑ (moderate)|Growth shock, inflation pass-through, loss of both EU and US trade|
|**Sweden**|SEK ↓ (modest)|Yields ↑ (mild)|External demand drop, capital market tightening globally|

## 🔵 Global Macro Consequences

* **Global recession**: Trade volumes collapse, business investment slows.

* **Oil prices fall**: US demand and global trade decline → oversupply.

* **Realignment of trade blocs**: EU–Asia–LatAm deepen integration; US becomes isolated.

* **Reshoring accelerates**, but at great transitional cost.

---

## ✅ Summary: The Isolation Spiral

* The **US shoots itself in the foot**: inflation, recession, currency decline, and capital flight.

* **Japan bears a heavy trade shock**, but partially offsets with safe-haven capital inflow.

* **UK and Sweden are collateral damage**, but with the capacity to realign globally faster than the US can rebuild trade flows internally.
