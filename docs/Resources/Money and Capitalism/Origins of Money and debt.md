## Introduction

This material is my own journey into trying to understanding the finance world  and what the consequences might be when provoked with new concepts and ideas.
The idea of an ever expanding capitalistic world seems difficult to coexist with our limited planet and its resources. Capitalism has served us well in developing our society, but the current consequences of global warming, AI and automation seems to lead to a world with very few beneficiaries and a whole lot more losers.
It is very easy to get caught up in thoughts of:
"There is nothing I can do?", "It is already too late", "what can I do as a mere mortal, big money is just to powerful"..

There are many ways we might have a revolution

Revolutions happen bottom - up as an idea or as a consequence of a disruptive change.

## Money

If you ask the question : "when and how is money created" you are likely to get as many answers as respondents.

The actual mechanisms of exchange rates, evaluation and governmental debt are not as easy to understand as you might think. There are many secondary consequences that are impacting in ways you didn't expect and some contra intuitive and strange.
