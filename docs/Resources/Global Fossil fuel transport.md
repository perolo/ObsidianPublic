As of 2021, fossil fuels—specifically oil, coal, and natural gas—comprised approximately 36% of global seaborne trade by volume. This includes around 15% for coal, 17% for natural gas, and 64% of globally produced oil transported by sea .([ics-shipping.org](https://www.ics-shipping.org/resource/shippings-role-in-the-global-energy-transition/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Shipping’s Role in the Global Energy Transition"))

In terms of shipping activity measured by ton-miles (a metric combining cargo volume and distance traveled), oil accounted for about 21% of global maritime transport in 2020. This represents a significant decline from 1970, when oil constituted 60% of global ton-miles . While specific ton-mile data for coal is less detailed, coal remains a major component of dry bulk shipping, which includes commodities like iron ore and grain.([Transport Systems Geography](https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter5/maritime-transportation/seaboard-trade-cargo-type/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "World Seaborne Trade by Cargo Type, 1970-2021"))

Overall, fossil fuels continue to play a substantial role in global maritime trade, both in terms of volume and shipping activity.
