Sometimes it becomes apparent that American English is not my first language and that I come from a different cultural value background.

When watching an American movie with a 2 bit gangster waves a gun around and demands "Respect" - my reaction is of Fear, never Respect. My response might resemble that of Respect - but my core value system is that this person has violated the basic social code that builds our society. I will appear to treat him with "Respect", but as soon as I feel safe and distant from that situation I will use all my power to fight that to ever happen again - no matter how long time it might take. My reaction and disgust might even make me do things that is in conflict with my own moral codes.

Respect is something you receive as a consequence of actions and values - if they coincide with our own there is a basis to build a growing Respect. Earning Respect is something that takes time to build. It can never be imposed by treats or violence.

Do I "Respect" Donald Taco Trump?
I definitely Fear him - he is the most powerful leader on this planet, and at the same time seems to be totally void of any competence or moral compass.
Not yet seen or experienced any actions that is aimed at building Trust and Confidence
"The art of the Deal" primarily seems to be aimed at enriching himself and his companies.

Can a man that lies so often that he actually starts believing in his own lies ever be Respected?
"Honor" is another concept that seems to have a difference social context in the Taco world - A man that lies is a man without Honor and a man without Honor can never be Respected.
"Loosing Face" is important in many parts of the world, but also being able to accept accountability for your mistakes. "Facing the music" or "Owning up to it" is even more important in Sweden - it is accepted that everyone makes mistakes and not being able to admin to it is one of the largest sins that would make you "Dead on arrival politically" . Taco is a self admitted Narcissist that never admits to any mistakes.

Donald Taco Trump is a bully - and we all know how we react to the ones that are too powerful - we bend a knee, but at first chance we would gladly stab him in the back, even letting that revenge spill over to any any victim we might associate with him - sorry all Americans, it takes time to forget and forgive.
Our understanding of fairness and just treatment within our social group is deeply programmed in our genes. If you ever have watched the reaction of the [monkey feeling unjustly rewarded for his work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KSryJXDpZo) understands that this reaction is a part of our internally programmed social values.
