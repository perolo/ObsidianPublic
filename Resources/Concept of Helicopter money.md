Certainly. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how **"helicopter money"** works, structured for an academic or economist audience, with a focus on monetary creation and accounting treatment:

---

### **Definition Recap**

**Helicopter money** is a form of **monetary-financed fiscal expansion**, where central banks inject money directly into the real economy, typically through direct transfers to households or government spending, **without creating corresponding liabilities (like bonds)**.

The term, popularized by Milton Friedman, metaphorically refers to dropping newly created money from a helicopter to stimulate demand.

### **Step-by-Step Mechanism**

#### **1. Monetary Creation: Where is the money created?**

* The **central bank** creates the money *ex nihilo* (out of nothing).

* This is done via **central bank balance sheet expansion**, typically through a **credit entry** to the liability side (reserves or other accounts).

* There is **no matching asset** like government bonds (as in QE); this is what distinguishes helicopter money from other monetary interventions.

 > 
 > **Accounting Entry at the Central Bank:**
 > 
 > * **Liabilities (↑):** New money created, e.g., deposits to Treasury/general public.
 > 
 > * **Assets:** No new asset acquired (unlike QE, where bonds are acquired).

---

#### **2. Transfer Mechanism: How does the money enter the economy?**

There are two primary channels, depending on institutional arrangements:

##### a. **Through the Government (Fiscal Conduit)**

* The central bank **credits the Treasury’s account** with newly created funds.

* The government then uses these funds for **transfers to households**, **infrastructure**, or **direct payments**.

 > 
 > *In this version, helicopter money resembles monetized fiscal stimulus.*

##### b. **Direct to Households (Uncommon in practice)**

* The central bank could, in theory, **credit individuals' accounts** directly (e.g., through central bank digital currencies).

* This would bypass the fiscal authority but raises legal and operational questions in most jurisdictions.

---

#### **3. Recording in National Accounts and Institutional Balance Sheets**

##### **Central Bank:**

* **Assets:** Unchanged or potentially includes a notional claim on the Treasury (zero-interest, perpetual).

* **Liabilities:** Increase in reserves or deposits of households/government.

##### **Treasury (if used as conduit):**

* **Assets:** Increase in deposits at central bank.

* **Liabilities:** None (if true helicopter money—no debt issued).

##### **Households:**

* **Assets:** Increase in cash/deposits.

* **Liabilities:** None (free transfer).

##### **Consolidated Public Sector:**

* This results in an increase in **net financial assets** of the private sector, **without increasing public sector debt**.

---

#### **4. Inflationary and Policy Implications**

* Helicopter money increases **aggregate demand** without a corresponding increase in government liabilities.

* It can be inflationary if the output gap is closed.

* It’s a **non-reversible** monetary expansion (unlike QE, which can be unwound by selling assets).

### **Key Takeaways**

* Money is created by the **central bank** as a liability without an offsetting asset.

* It enters the economy via **direct transfers** (to the Treasury or households).

* It increases **private sector net wealth** without increasing public debt.

* It's a **highly expansionary tool**—used typically as a last resort when conventional monetary and fiscal tools are exhausted.
